My colleagues David Wooff, Michael Goldstein and I wrote a chapter for the book \`Analytic Methods in Systems and Software Testing' (Wiley, 2018, edited by Kenett, Ruggeri and Faltin). The chapter (pp. 213-243) is entitled \`Bayesian Graphical Models for High Complexity Testing: Aspects of Implementation' and is available [here](bgm-Wooff-Goldstein-Coolen-final-170323.pdf).
